## 1. Why is timely delivery crucial in software project management, and how can project managers ensure that deadlines are met?
Timely Delivery is crucial as it keeps the project on schedule, it helps ensure project managers meet deadlines by developing detailed timelines and identifying milestones. Managers can further ensure deadlines are met by making use of tools such as Gantt Charts and Timelines or even using project management software that incorporates these tools and uses tracking techniques such as the Critical path method.
## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
Cost control contributes by allowing for the estimation of costs concerning resources materials and equipment. This means budgeting techniques can be effectively implemented into the project, preventing issues of lack of resources due to low funds. Strategies include developing a budget plan with clear estimations and alternatives.
## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile is an iterative approch to software development that is also incremental . This means 

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
Agile methodologies are more beneficial when flexibility is needed and if the project has a strict strained deadline. This is because it allows for features to be added as they go on a good example would be a shopping application, the basics can be created and features or improvements can be added with consumer feedback.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
The initial method is the Process-oriented approach which is very proactive and requires potential dangers for error to be identified before the process begins. This reduces the risk of error as all potential pitfalls and solutions or alternatives are considered as it focuses on preventing defects. 
Maintaining high standards ensures that not only is your project of quality but is competitive in the market. It can also be compared internationally and improved based on the quality standard given.

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
The project scope defines the limits and requirements of your project. This helps with successful project planning because it ensures that each step and task made is within the limits of resources needed for the overall development of the software. A Work breakdown structure is "a deliverable-oriented hierarchical decomposition of the work to be executed to accomplish the project objectives and create the required deliverables" This means it breakdowns the overall project into pieces, helps define the scope of the project, and outlines what the output at each step should be.

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?


## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?

## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?

## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?

## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?

## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?

## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?
Understanding the market helps to orient your project and software development. This means you are able to develop software that can be used practically in the market. It will also be up-to-date with the changes in the industry and keep it relevant in the market.
